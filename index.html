				<b>Counter-Strike is the most recognizable game of all the times.</b> It was originally a MOD of Half Life made by Minh “Gooseman” Le and Jess “Cliffe” Cliffe. A tactical shooter that became an instant online success. It would later be released in 2000 by Valve, the original producers of Half- Life.

				<b>CS spread across the globe and found ways to grow in different cultures.</b><br>
				Looking at each version of Counter-Strike we can find that it hasn’t changed so much since the game's inception as a mod for Half-Life back in 2000. That's one of the beautiful things about this hardcore, competitive shooter: It hasn't changed much in over a decade because it doesn't need to. Similar to a game such as StarCraft, where other real-time-strategy games had come before it, other tactical shooters had come before CS. But the perfect elements of physics and game play melded together and from there a dedicated fan base took the game to its legendary status.

				<b>Counter-Strike has been instrumental in pushing the competitive gaming movement forward.</b> It is the most globally-influential shooter of all time, with teams from all over the world regularly competing in international tournaments. Once in the hands of top gamers, CS lent itself to innovation. Check out how some of these players somehow know that players are running behind exact spots in certain walls or about to turn a corner. The team-based nature of Counter Strike highlighted a level of teamwork other games had yet to possess. For this reason the top gamers all gravitated towards CS.
