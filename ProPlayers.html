				<b>Counter-Strike has been pushing the competitive gaming movement forward.</b> It is the most globally-influential shooter of all time. Teams from all around the world has been regularly competing in huge international championships. The longevity of the title is unmatched in the realm of shooters. Fans can will find number of things that make its appeal long-lasting. And certainly there are many factors that CS perfected. Firstly, weapon firing (with no auto-aim) rewards skilful players for precision shooting, since damage is based on the body a player is shot. Counter-Strike use only real-life weapons. This is certainly an appeal for fans that could never get into the crazy fantastic shooters like Unreal Tournament. The quality of online play made it viable for competitive matches, pushing the game forward to the professional ranks. Once in the hands of top gamers, CS lent itself to innovation. Check out how some of these players somehow know that enemies are running behind exact spots in the other side of walls or about to turn a corner. Despite focusing heavily on teamwork, the level of individual skill still can make the difference between victory and defeat in CS. Lastly, the team-based nature of the game highlighted a level of teamwork other games probably will never be able to reach. That’s why the top gamers all gravitated towards CS and reaffirmed it as the most competitive game of the world.
